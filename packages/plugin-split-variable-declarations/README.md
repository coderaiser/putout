> - The [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
> - [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) statements are also block-scoped. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared. However, if a constant is an **object** or **array** its properties or items can be updated or removed.

🐊[**Putout**](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout) plugin adds ability to find and split variable declarations because (re)moving a line is simpler and less error prone then changing coma (`,`) to colon (`;`).

For the same reason, **diff** of changed declarations are more comfortable to read.
